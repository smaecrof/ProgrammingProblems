DESCRIPTION OF THE JAVA PROJECT:
CREATED BY: SPENCER MAE-CROFT
DATE CREATED: 07/30/2020


* Creating a simple interface (ISaveable)
* The interface allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medium (arraylist) 
* The type of the medium is not known to the interface (nor to the classes that implement the interface)
* The interface will specify two methods, one to return the ArrayList of values to be saved and the 
* other to populate the object's fields from an ArrayList (parameter)

* Creating a few ample classes that implement ISaveable 
* Override toString() for each class so that they can easily print for testing purposes 
* In Main, write a method that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and "Saves" 
* the values e.g. calls the method defined in the interface. 

* Our method will simply print the values to the screen 
* In the Main class, have a method that restores the values to a Saveable object 
	- Calls the method from the interface for populating fields
