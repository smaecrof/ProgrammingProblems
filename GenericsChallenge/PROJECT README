Challenge:
- ArrayList<Team> teams; 
- Collections.sort(teams); 

- Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport 
	- The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store a list 
	of teams that belong to the league
	
	
- The class should have a method to print out the teams in order, 
with the team at the top of the league printed first 

- Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular instance of the league class 
	- The program should fail to compile if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
